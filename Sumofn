Aim:- To write a python program to print the sum of first n numbers using function.

Algorithm:-

1. Define a function called sum_of_first_n that takes an integer n as an argument.

2. Initialize a variable called sum to 0.

3. Loop through all the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) using a for loop.

4. Add each number to the sum.

5. After the loop ends, return the sum from the function.

6. Take an input integer n from the user.

7. Call the sum_of_first_n function with n as an argument and store the returned value in a variable called result.

8. Print the value of result to display the sum of the first n numbers.
